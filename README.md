# pgen

a simple utility to generate passwords.
It also keeps a history of the passwords generated within the filesystem, so you don't risk forgetting them.
Nothing complicated like excel sheets, csv etc etc, but two command line options

- g : Generate a new password, specify length, label and if you want include punctuation, special chars and numbers
- h : Show generated password history

That's all
